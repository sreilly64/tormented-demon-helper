# Tormented Demon Helper
This plugin adds quality of life improvements when fighting Tormented Demons (TDs).

## Features:

### Accuracy boost tracking
- Roughly 30 ticks after either engaging in combat with a TD or after their fire bomb attack, the player's accuracy is increased to 100% until the next fire bomb.
- This plugin tracks this boost timer and displays it as a counter on/above the TD (position is configurable).
- The timer is color coded to distinguish between unboosted and boosted ticks (colors are configurable).
