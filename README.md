# Tormented Demon Helper
This plugin adds quality of life improvements when fighting Tormented Demons (TDs).

## Features:

### Accuracy boost tracking
- Roughly 25 ticks after either engaging in combat with a TD or after their fire bomb attack, the player's accurracy will be increased to 100% until the next fire bomb.
- This plugin tracks this boost timer and displays it as a counter above the TD and/or as an icon on the TD denoting that the boost is active.

### TD Attack style highlighting
- When fighting multiple TDs, it can be difficult to keep track of which attack style each one is using.
- After a TD has performed an attack, this plugin can reactively highlight the TD with a color coded outline indicating which attack style it is currently using. 
- The highlight colors can be configured, but the default values are:
    - red = melee
    - blue = mage
    - green = range
    - yellow = fire bomb
